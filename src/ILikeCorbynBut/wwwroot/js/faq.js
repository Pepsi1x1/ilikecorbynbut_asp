    "answer": 
        "Jeremy Corbyn is a <i>democratic socialist</i>. He believes that our current economic system isn't doing enough for the poor and working class in our society and that democratic change is needed to create a fairer and more just society.<br><br>" + 
        "But this isn't radical or scary. Many of the programs instituted by post war governments that we take for granted today &mdash; such as the NHS, the limited hours of work, the minimum wage, and Social Security &mdash; are socialist programs."

    "question": "... I heard he wants to increase taxes!",
   "answer": "Most people will be better off under Corbyn's tax plan and Jeremy will make sure that the richest in our society that avoid tax will contribute their fair share like the rest of us." +
		"These are the proposals: " + 
		"<ul><li>Reverse the cuts to Corporation Tax.</li>" +
		"<li>Reverse cuts to Inheritance Tax</li>" +		
		"<li>Introduce a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax\" target=\"_blank\">land value tax</a></li>" +
		"<li>Increase the top rate of tax to 50p from the current rate 45p.  This rate is only paid on income over the &pound;150,000 threshold. Ed Miliband was hoping to introduce this last year had Labour won in 2015 - and 83% of members polled agreed that this was the correct policy.</li></ul>" +
		"<p>Crucially - Jeremy has said he would intervene to enforce laws on British overseas territories and dependencies if they do not comply with UK tax law, introduce anti-avoidance measures into UK law, and invest in HMRC so they can hire the staff needed to collect the tax the country badly needs.</p>"

    "question": "... is he even electable?",
    "answer": 
        "Corbyn has attracted a massive numbers of new and very enthusiastic members.  With the right strategy, and hard work by us all, of course he is electable. That means persuading people of the case  for Corbyn as a different kind of leader and for the kind of society he wants to help build. He and his team are appealing to people who <span class=\"jcblack\"><strong>used to be cynical</strong></span> about politics or resigned to accepting whatever is dished out to them.  Their involvement and support has helped us to grow to become the the largest socialist party in Europe."

    "answer":

    "answer": 
        "Corbyn's supporters are from a wide variety of age groups and walks of life. His supporters have been unfairly targeted by critics of Jeremy as a way to damage his credibility. After attending a meeting in Derby Paul Rogers (Bradford University) <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/paul-rogers/corbyn-crowd-and-its-signal\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> <i>\"I doubt that any other politician could have attracted such a crowd at the present time, nor for many years, at least in the English midlands. The mood was positive, appreciative but not 'over the top'. <strong>It was as far from a cult as you could imagine</strong>\". [emphasis added].

	"id": "terrorist-sympathiser", 
	"question": "...I've heard he's is a terrorist sympathiser", 
	"answer": 
		"Jeremy has always believed that war needs to be last course of action and peace is always preferable. He believes in pursuing diplomatic or political solutions rather than putting the lives of British soldiers at risk. Like many politicians during the troubles with the IRA, Jeremy was attempting to bring together both sides to broker peace and his belief in transparency meant that unlike other politicians he did not keep this secret. We now know however that the <a href=“https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/16/northernireland.thatcher”>UK Government were involved in secret talks </a>. Despite the hysteria around Jeremy’s interest in diplomacy these ideas are not new - indeed in 2009, David Miliband spoke of drawing from our experiences with the IRA to <a href=“https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/27/british-government-secret-talks-ira”>engage in talks with ‘moderate elements’ of the Taliban.</a><br><br>As a life-long campaigner against fascism of all forms - Jeremy has taken a very clear approach against racist and discriminatory ideologies. He has said that he would not negotiate with fascist groups like ISIS - but instead of bombing the countries that they occupy, killing innocent civilians, he sees the solution in a political process starving these groups of the funds they need to survive.</p>"

	"id":"military-and-national-security",
	"question":"...his attitudes about defence worry me", 
	"answer":"Corbyn takes the security and defence of the UK seriously, but his approach to security is significantly different from many other leaders - emphasising security not only for us in the UK, but for our troops in foreign countries. He sees conflict as a last resort. <p>From the Defence Policy Review 2016: \"The safety and security of the British people must always be our first priority. This can only be achieved by a defence and security policy which is strategic, informed by expert opinion and supported by a strong evidence base.\"</p><p>It is Labour policy to continue to spend 2% of GDP on defence.</p>" +
	"On Trident: Jeremy believes that the £167 Billion cost is better spent in other areas of defence, and he believes that the UK has a duty to join others in getting rid of weapons that can never be used or would destroy our planet. As a Trade Unionist, as Prime Minister Jeremy would ensure that the skilled scientists and engineers currently building weapons will be given new roles building the technology of the future.</a>"

    "id": "how-old-is-he-again",
    "question": "... he's too old!",
    "answer": "At 71, Jeremy Corbyn would be the oldest Prime Minister ever elected to a first term. He is now a fit and healthy 67 year old. Angela Eagle said of him during the EU Referendum that he was pursuing an agenda that would make a 25-year-old tired. He has demonstrated remarkable stamina during the current leadership campaign and is supported by strong cabinet team of experienced politicians and campaigners."
